# Vue.js Practice

This is my practice repository containing personal projects I've created to understand Vue.js.  Currently I'm following along with the ebook [30 Days of Vue](https://www.newline.co/30-days-of-vue/) and am about halfway through this material.

Along with Vue.js practice I'm also taking the opportunity to learn more in-depth methods of source control with git.
